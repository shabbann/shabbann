* 👀 About me
    - Computer/ Communcations Engineer student
    - I have a lot of passion towards open source collaborating but currently i'm still learning ⏲️
    - I begin my study of fields/theory by searching for a good book that will take me through a journey of learning about theory exploring the initial thoughts of its pioneers and the challenges they encountered.
 Though it may take time, the potential gains are significant.
- ❓ Ask me about anything. I will try to help you as much as I can.
